Loops, like decisions, are one of those things that are to be found everywhere in algorithms and coding. 

As you might guess from the name, loops go round and round in circles.

On the left is a Flode chart that shows a very simple loop. Step through it and see how it works. 

As you can see, all it does is count from 0 to 9 and displays each value as it counts in the console.

Once you understand this, you are understanding one of the most common things in programming.
